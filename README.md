## Preparation

We suggest to install all the useful libraries in a virtual environment in order to have the same version and to not create confilcts and warnings.

First of all in a command line:

`virtualenv env`

Then activate it

`source env/bin/activate`

Then install al the libraries used with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Execution

In order to execute all the files you must run:

`python main.py`

## Report

In the report directory you will find the report of the whole work.
